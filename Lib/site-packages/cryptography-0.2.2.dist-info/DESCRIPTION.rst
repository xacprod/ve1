``cryptography`` is a package designed to expose cryptographic recipes and
primitives to Python developers.  Our goal is for it to be your "cryptographic
standard library". It supports Python 2.6-2.7, Python 3.2+, and PyPy.

``cryptography`` includes both high level recipes, and low level interfaces to
common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message digests and
key derivation functions. For example, to encrypt something with
``cryptography``'s high level symmetric encryption recipe:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
    >>> # Put this somewhere safe!
    >>> key = Fernet.generate_key()
    >>> f = Fernet(key)
    >>> token = f.encrypt(b"A really secret message. Not for prying eyes.")
    >>> token
    '...'
    >>> f.decrypt(token)
    'A really secret message. Not for prying eyes.'
